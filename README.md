# IoT Data Collection and Analysis

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) application that connects devices and sensors to the internet, collects data, and performs actions based on the data. The application uses MQTT as the communication protocol, Mosquitto as the message broker, and Node-RED as the dashboard. It also utilizes AWS IoT for cloud-based management of devices and data analysis.
